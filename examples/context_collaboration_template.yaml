# This YAML-serialized data file is intended to help an LLM
# understand how to perform subset mapping.
# It is compliant with the context_collaboration_schema LinkML schema
# If the LLM doesn't think that it has been provided with the corresponding schema file
# or any other and other input data files then it should ask for them
# The LLM must populate the following fields. confidence, mixs_context_label, mixs_environment_label, ontology_class_label, ontology_class_slug
# The LLM may populate comment if it thinks that comment will help the human during curation
# The LLM should not bother populating agent or timestamp. The human will take care of that.
# this example is in YAML, but the LLM should emit its responses in an isomorphic JSON format

  comment:
  - High confidence due to the typical presence of well-developed soil ecosystems,
    but allowing for slight uncertainty due to potential variations in specific forest
    types or environmental conditions.

  - confidence:0.6|comment:Moderate confidence as village biomes involve soil interaction
    due to human settlements and agricultural activities, but acknowledging variability
    depending on land use practices and infrastructure.

  comment:
  - High confidence as built environments fall under anthropogenic influences, but
    acknowledging the inclusion of non-built environments within this category.
