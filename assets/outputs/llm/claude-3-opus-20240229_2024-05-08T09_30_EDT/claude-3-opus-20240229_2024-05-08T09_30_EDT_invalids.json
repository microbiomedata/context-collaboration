      "comment": "While eutrophic lakes are a specific type of lake characterized by high nutrient content, using this term is redundant and unnecessarily specific, as its parent class 'lake' has already been mapped. The more general term 'lake' should be used to avoid inconsistency and maintain an appropriate level of specificity in the mapping."
