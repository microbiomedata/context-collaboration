ENVO_03501109	subway train	0.1	env_local_scale	Soil	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	A subway train is not a reasonable local environmental context for soil samples, as it is an artificial, mobile environment that is not typically associated with soil ecosystems or processes.
ENVO:00002259	agricultural soil	0.2	env_local_scale	Agriculture	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	The ENVO term 'ENVO:00002259' for 'agricultural soil' is not present in the provided input and cannot be used for mapping in this context.
ENVO_00000081	man-made tunnel	0.1	env_local_scale	BuiltEnvironment	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	The ENVO term 'ENVO_00000081' is associated with the label 'mountain' in the input, not 'man-made tunnel'. This mismatch between the term and its label makes the mapping invalid.
ENVO_01000419	domestic garden	0.1	env_local_scale	WastewaterSludge	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	A domestic garden is not a relevant local environmental context for wastewater sludge samples, as these samples are typically associated with wastewater treatment facilities or related infrastructure.
ENVO_01000254	environmental system	0.2	env_local_scale	MicrobialMatBiofilm	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	The ENVO term 'environmental system' is too broad and generic to provide a meaningful local environmental context for microbial mat and biofilm samples. More specific terms related to the particular habitats or conditions associated with these samples should be used.
ENVO_00000020	lake	0.95	env_local_scale	Water	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	Lakes are a specific type of hydrographic feature that are highly relevant for providing local environmental context for water samples, as they represent more static, lentic water bodies.
ENVO_00000548	eutrophic lake	0.3	env_local_scale	Water	claude-3-opus-20240229	2024-05-08T09_30 EDT	While eutrophic lakes are a specific type of lake characterized by high nutrient content, using this term is redundant and unnecessarily specific, as its parent class 'lake' has already been mapped. The more general term 'lake' should be used to avoid inconsistency and maintain an appropriate level of specificity in the mapping.
