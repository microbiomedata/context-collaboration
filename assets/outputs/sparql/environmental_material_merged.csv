"" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.

The lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm.""

In sea ice operations however, sea ice is any form of ice found at sea which has originated from the freezing of sea water. It presents the main kind of floating ice encountered at sea. Except where it forms ridges, sea ice is up to a few metres thick, in which respect it differs from shelf ice.  Sea ice may be discontinuous pieces (ice floes) moved on the ocean surface by wind and currents (pack ice), or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). In brief, it forms first as lolly ice (frazil crystals), thickens into sludge, and coagulates into sheet ice, pancake ice, or into floes of various shapes and sizes. Thereafter, sea ice may develop into pack ice and/or become a form of pressure ice.  Sea ice less than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that survives at least one summer. It may be subdivided into second-year ice and multi-year ice, where multiyear ice has survived at least two summers.",Water ice which has formed by the freezing of sea water.,Parse comment from GCW and new subclases where appropriate.,,,,,,envoPolar,ENVO_01001557,,,,,liquid water|saline water|sea water,,,,freezing|freezing of water into water ice,,,,,,,,sea ice|water ice|ice,,,freezing of water into water ice|freezing,,,,freezing|freezing of water into water ice,,

ENVO_01000016,silt,,"This definition is intentionally ambiguous to support the multiple thresholds set by different authorities. Some authorities consider this soil material that contains 80% or more silt and less than 12% clay. In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve).

ENVO_01000277,water ice,,"Water ice can appear transparent or opaque bluish-white color, depending on the presence of impurities or air inclusions. The addition of other materials such as soil may further alter its appearance.

When speaking about ice on Earth, usually water ice is meant - the solid, crystalline form of water found in the atmosphere as snow crystals, hail, ice pellets, etc., and on the earth's surface in forms such as hoarfrost, rime, glaze, sea ice, glacier ice, ground ice, frazil, anchor ice, etc.

This form of water is, strictly speaking, called ice Ih, the Roman numeral I distinguishing it from more than a dozen other phases and the letter h distinguishing it from the metastable cubic phase ice Ic. Ice Ih is the only one of the several known phases of water ice that is stable at commonly occurring temperatures and pressures. (Some of the other forms have very unusual properties, ice VII, for example, being stable only at pressures above 22 400 kg/cm^2, but then existing at temperatures up to about 100C.)

It has an open structure with a specific gravity of 0.9166 which is slightly less than water; because the water molecules bond to their neighbors covalently only in four directions; it therefore floats on higher density water, where broken molecular bonds permit closer packing. All commonly occurring forms of ice are crystalline, although large single crystals are relatively rare except in glaciers. The ice crystal lattice possesses hexagonal symmetry that manifests itself in the gross forms of such single crystals as are sometimes found in snow. At an air pressure of one atmosphere, ice melts at 0 C by definition of the Celsius temperature scale. (Strictly speaking the equilibrium point among water, ice, and vapor occurs at +0.01C, the triple point.) On the other hand, ice does not invariably form in liquid water cooled below this temperature; it has a tendency to supercool, more so in the absence of ice nuclei.

In permafrost regions, ice may occupy voids in soils and rocks and may develop in a variety of forms. Ice may be colourless to pale blue or greenish-blue. It may appear white due to included gas bubbles; in exposures, ground ice may also appear black.

In nature ice is formed either by: (a) the freezing of water, (b) the condensation of atmospheric water vapour direct into ice crystals, (c) the compaction of snow with or without the motion of a glacier, or (d) the impregnation of porous snow masses with water which subsequently freeze.",Ice which is formed from water.,,,,,ice,,envoPolar,ENVO_01001125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ice|water ice,,,,,,,,,

Rime is composed essentially of discrete ice granules and has densities as low as 0.2-0.3 g cm-3. Glaze is generally continuous but with some air pockets and has much higher densities. Factors that favor rime formation are small drop size, slow accretion, a high degree of supercooling, and rapid dissipation of latent heat of fusion. The opposite effects favor glaze formation. Both rime and glaze occur when supercooled water drops strike an object at a temperature below freezing. Such formation on terrestrial objects constitutes an ice storm; on aircraft, it is called aircraft icing (where rime is known as rime ice). Either rime or glaze may form on snow crystals, droxtals, or other ice particles in the atmosphere. When such a deposit is wholly or chiefly of rime, snow pellets result; when most or all of the deposit is glaze, ordinary hail or ice pellets result. The alternating clear and opaque layers of some hailstones represent glaze and rime, deposited under varying conditions around the growing hailstone.","Water ice which 1) has a white or milky and opaque appearance, 2) has a granular texture, and 3) is formed as a result of the deposition and rapid freezing of supercooled water drops as they make contact with an exposed object.","The previously use definition was: Frost which is 1) composed primarily of granular ice tufts, 2) formed on the windward sides of exposed objects through contact with supercooled fog or cloud, and 3) built out directly against the wind.",,,,,,envoPolar; envoCryo,ENVO_01001850,,granular|opaque|optical quality|quality of interaction of a substance with electromagnetic radiation|opacity,water ice crystal,,,,,desublimation of water vapour into ice|desublimation process,desublimation of water vapour into ice|desublimation process,granular|quality of interaction of a substance with electromagnetic radiation|opaque|optical quality|opacity,,,,water ice|ice|water ice crystal,granular|quality of interaction of a substance with electromagnetic radiation|opaque|optical quality|opacity,,rime|frost,,ice|water ice|water ice crystal,desublimation of water vapour into ice|desublimation process,water ice|ice|water ice crystal,,,desublimation of water vapour into ice|desublimation process,,

It occurs at very low temperatures, and usually in clear, calm weather in high latitudes. The sun is usually visible and may cause halo phenomena or luminous pillars. Ice fog is rare at temperatures warmer than -30 Â°C, and increases in frequency with decreasing temperature until it is almost always present at air temperatures of -45 Â°C in the vicinity of a source of water vapor. Such sources are the open water of fast-flowing streams or of the sea, herds of animals, volcanoes, and especially products of combustion for heating or propulsion.
