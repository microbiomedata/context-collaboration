ENVO_01001369,tidal mangrove shrubland,,"This class aligns to the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). In ENVO, we may adapt the definition for consistency, but the semantics (meaning) of the term should be unaffected. Please consult the CMECS catalogue (https://cmecscatalog.org/) for authoritative and semantically unconstrained definitions. CMECS provides the following notes: ""Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group. Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F""","A shrubland biome which is densely vegetated by dwarf or short mangroves (and associates) that are generally less than 6 meters in height, is tidally influenced,  is located in tropical or subtropical areas.",,,,,,,envoCmecs; envoMarine,ENVO_01000176,,,,tidal mangrove shrubland|terrestrial biome|terrestrial ecosystem|shrubland biome,clay|soil|sand|particulate environmental material|organic material|mineral material|particle of sand|particle of silt|terrestrial biome|silt|particle|particle of clay|mangrove swamp|mangrove biome|coastal wetland ecosystem|sea coast|pedosphere|wetland ecosystem|coast|terrestrial ecosystem|soil surface layer|soil layer,
ENVO_01001505,alpine tundra biome,,"The absence of trees in this biome is primarily due to high altitude rather than high latitude. On Earth, it lies roughly between the summer isotherm of 10 degrees Centigrade and the snow line.
