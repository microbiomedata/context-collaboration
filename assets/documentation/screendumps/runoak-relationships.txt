runoak relationships --help
Usage: runoak relationships [OPTIONS] [TERMS]...

  Show all relationships for a term or terms

  By default, this shows all relationships where the input term(s) are the
  *subjects*

  Example:

      runoak -i cl.db relationships CL:4023094

  Like all OAK commands, a label can be passed instead of a CURIE

  Example:

      runoak -i cl.db relationships neuron

  To reverse the direction, and query where the search term(s) are *objects*,
  use the --direction flag:

  Example:

      runoak -i cl.db relationships --direction down neuron

  Multiple terms can be passed

  Example:

      runoak -i uberon.db relationships heart liver lung

  And like all OAK commands, a query can be passed rather than an explicit
  term list

  The following query lists all arteries in the limb together which what
  structures they supply

  Query:

      runoak -i uberon.db relationships -p RO:0002178 .desc//p=i "artery" .and
      .desc//p=i,p "limb"

Options:
  -p, --predicates TEXT           A comma-separated list of predicates. This
                                  may be a shorthand (i, p) or CURIE
  --direction [up|down|both]      direction of traversal over edges, which up
                                  is subject to object, down is object to
                                  subject.
  --autolabel / --no-autolabel    If set, results will automatically have
                                  labels assigned  [default: autolabel]
  -O, --output-type TEXT          Desired output type
  -o, --output FILENAME           Output file, e.g. obo file
  --if-absent [absent-only|present-only]
                                  determines behavior when the value is not
                                  present or is empty.
  -S, --set-value TEXT            the value to set for all terms for the given
                                  property.
  --include-entailed / --no-include-entailed
                                  Include entailed indirect relationships
                                  [default: no-include-entailed]
  --non-redundant-entailed / --no-non-redundant-entailed
                                  Include entailed but exclude entailed
                                  redundant relationships  [default: no-non-
                                  redundant-entailed]
  --include-tbox / --no-include-tbox
                                  Include class-class relationships (subclass
                                  and existentials)  [default: include-tbox]
  --include-abox / --no-include-abox
                                  Include instance relationships (class and
                                  object property assertions)  [default:
                                  include-abox]
  --include-metadata / --no-include-metadata
                                  Include metadata (axiom annotations)
                                  [default: no-include-metadata]
