comments:
  - This LinkML schema defines the structural aspects of performing subset mappings between environmental extensions in the Minimal Information about any (X) Sequence standard (MIxS) and class terms from ontologies like the Environment Ontology (ENVO)
  - It can be provided as context for a large language model. Additional files, like the definitions of the EnvO classes and some example mappings will need to be provided too. The LLM should ask for those files if it doesn't think they have been provided.
  - As the additional files are provided, the LLM should not provide any analytical summary. It should only acknowledge receipt of the data and ask whether there are any more data inputs or whether the first subset mapping should begin.
  - The MIxS standard defines environmental context questions (fields, parameters) about nucleic acid sequences and the samples they come from. The international sequence databases require submitters to provide answers to those questions, but the submitter can choose what environmental extension they will be constrained by. There are some core questions and some questions that are dependent on the environmental extension that the submitter has chosen.
  - The MIxS environmental extensions are defined in the permissible_values of the mixs_environment_label_enum
  - Three environmental context questions are defined in the permissible_values of mixs_context_label_enum
  - Subset mapping is an alignment process of pre-determining sets of ontology classes that are reasonable choices for answering the MIxS environmental context questions, within the scope of a given MIxS environmental extension. The subsets are required because there are so many classes in EnvO and other applicable ontologies that it is difficult for people to choose the right ones unless they are already experts in both environmental science and formal ontology.
  - It is essential that the LLM and the human user communicate in an efficient and clearly defined manner. In general, the human user will be responsible for asking questions like "What are all of the EnvO biome classes that could be used to answer the env_broad_scale question in combination in the MIxS Soil environment? The LLM is then responsible for answering that question with the best sensitivity, specificity and relevance possible. The LLM should provide as many mappings it can for each question, given the guidance above. The LLM must provide its responses in a format that follows this schema exactly. However, the human user may be responsible for aggregating the responses into a document by copying and pasting output from a webpage or the command line.
  - The classes that can be used to answer the environmental context questions will come from OWL ontologies, generally from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (OBO). The ontology files can be quite large relative to the input token limit, so the human will provide summary files in a tabular format like CSV.
  - The CSV files may loose some of the structural knowledge in the ontology. One mechanism for generating them is with SPARQL queries. When that is the case, it may be useful to show the LLM the SPARQL questions that are used to generate the tables.
  - To obtain the best result, the LLM should descend the hierarchy until it gets to some key classes from which all subclasses are acceptable responses to the environmental context question/environmental extension constraint. The LLM should then report that key class.
  - The LLM should not apply any lexical or semantic reasoning of its own about the relatedness of the classes. The superclass assertions in the input should be considered the only knowledge of hierarchy.
  - The LLM's responses must always include both the mapped ontology class's identifier and the class' label, and those pairing must match the pairing in the input data exactly.
  - In this project, the human may identify ontology classes with slugs or CURIes. Slugs usw an underscore as teh delimiter between teh namespace and the local identifiers. CURIes use a colon. The LLM must always refer to the classes with their slug format identifiers.
  - This schema provides a comment field for each mapping. The LLM is allowed to provide a comment if some followup curation may be required. The LLM should assume that all humans involved are near-experts in this domain. Definitions and background knowledge should not be provided in the comments.
  - The schema also provides a required confidence slot (ie field) for all mappings. No formula or ruleset has been determined for confidence scoring yet. The scores should be stepped in 0.1 increments. The confidences in teh examples mappings are a good guide for future confidence determination. The LLM should not report mappings for which the score is less than 0.5, ie the LLM is less than 50% sure that the mapping is valid.
  - The LLM must provide values for following fields... confidence, mixs_context_label, mixs_environment_label, ontology_class_label, ontology_class_slug
  - The LLM must populate agent or timestamp. The LLM should ask the human for those values.
  - This schema also describes a mechanism for tracking the importance and completion status of the different environmental extensions. The LLM is responsible for keeping track of that information, but it should only be provided when the human asks for a categorical status report. Categorical status information should never be intermingled with the subset mappings. The LLM should start out by placing all environmental extensions in the skipped category if their status annotation is not "highest-advertised", "high-advertised" or "medium-unacknowledged". All others should start out as "pending"

          The system(s) identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide
          the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. in
          the desert or a rainforest). We recommend using subclasses of the EnvO biome
          class, ENVO_00000428.

          local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences
          on your sample or specimen. We recommend using EnvO terms which are of smaller
          spatial grain than your entry for env_broad_scale. Terms, such as anatomical
          sites, from other OBO Library ontologies which interoperate with EnvO (e.g.
          UBERON) are accepted in this field

          as long as they reference mass/volume nouns (e.g. air, water, blood) and
          not discrete, countable entities (e.g. a tree, a leaf, a table top)
